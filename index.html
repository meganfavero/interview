<h3> What do you want to design?</h3>
		</span>
		<div class= "p1">
			<p>
				I have bachelor’s degree in fine arts so I want to combine fine arts and graphic design together. So many people think that fine art is something that hard to understand and reach. If I can communicate fine art with graphic design then everybody can get that.
			</p>

<h3> What is difficult or frustrating for you within design and how do you work to push past that? </h3>
		</span>
		<div class="p2">
			<p>
				I’m doing so many assignment in the class and sometime I use the same colour matching for many classes as same as a typeface. After I realized that I try to match new colour that I never use before.
			</p>

		<span class="third">
<h3> What do you see yourself doing after you finish this program? </h3>
		</span>
		<div class="p3">
			<p>
				It’s hard to think about that now but I hope that I can find a job here as a graphic designer. I already had 4 years experience back in my country about teaching (Jewelry Design and drawing) but graphic design is new challenge for me.
			</p>
		</div>
		<span class= "fourth">
			<h3> What excites you about design? </h3>
					</span>
			<div class="p4">
				<p>
					I always excited to learn new program and push myself to design something that I never try before. I try so hard to go beyond my own expectation.
				</p>
			</div>
		<span class= "fifth">
<h3> What worries you about design? </h3>
		</span>
		<div class= "p5">
			<p>
				For now, doing all designs are fun and so challenge however, I still worried when I work with a client is not only design what I think is the best, but also can match with the concept from client.
			</p>
		</div>
		<span class="sixth">
<h3> Can design change the world? </h3>
		</span>
		<div class="p6">
			<p>
				Yes, I think it can make a really big change. Art and design are a media for communication between people and it is more national than language. Designers design something to response the demanding of human that always innovate technology, create theory and design product to make life more comfortable.
			</p>
		</div>
		<span class="seventh">
<h3> What is a website? </h3>
		</span>
		<div class= "p7">
			<p>
				In my opinion, It is an online platform that link people together. It’s an interactive platform that we use to communicate to each other. It can be text that people want to pronounce or campaign to help other people. Actually, it can be anything that we use to communicate with other people around the world.
